The task is to implement a parallel program that counts the number of prime numbers less than a given number and finds a list of all twin primes less than the given number and also the twin prime pairs. A twin prime pair being a prime number that has a prime gap of 2. For acheiving parallelism, Open\+MP was used as follows\+:

\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
The task is to implement a parallel program that counts the number of prime numbers less than a given number and finds a list of all twin primes less than the given number and also the twin prime pairs. A twin prime pair being a prime number that has a prime gap of 2. For acheiving parallelism, Open\+MP was used as follows\+: 


\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
 & {\em pragma} & omp parallel – this is the basic directive that defines the code that it will execute in parallel and is used to fork supplementary threads to carry out the work attached in the block of code after the \#pragma construct. The block will be all executed in parallel by all the threads. \\
\hline
 & {\em pragma} & omp parallel for – used in the code above divides the iterations of the for loop between the produced threads. \\
\hline
 & {\em pragma} & omp parallel for schedule(dynamic) – schedule controls how the loop iterations are distributed between the threads. Static means that it is determined at the beginning which thread will do which value and dynamic means that each thread will work on a portion of values and then take the next portion which has not been processed by any thread. Dynamic improves balancing even though it involves some communication overheads. \\
\hline
 & {\em pragma} & omp parallel for schedule(dynamic) num\+\_\+threads(number\+Of\+Threads) – sets limits on the amount of threads that \\
\hline
 & {\em pragma} & omp critical – defines the section of the code that must be executed by only a single thread at the time. Only one thread can enter a critical section at a time; others are kept at the entrance to critical section. This directive prevents any race conditions from happening \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
